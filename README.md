# pop-fridge

Everyone is guilty of not finishing what's left in their fridge. Sometimes we forget what we've bought, maybe our fridge is so full we can't see what's in the back, or you don't remember to check when your produce expires. That's where pop fridge comes in. 
 
The objective is to minimize food waste in your refrigerator by reminding users of what's in their fridge and keep track of items and their expiration dates.
